   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Application grouping for related deployments
   - Health checks after deployment

6. **✅ Robust Configuration Management**
   - JSON-based configuration with validation
   - Per-application settings and global defaults
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Hot-reload capability for configuration changes

7. **✅ Command Line Interface**
   - System validation (`--validate`)
   - IIS component listing (`--list-pools`, `--list-sites`)
   - Manual deployment triggering (`--deploy <name>`)
   - Interactive monitoring mode
   - Help and usage information

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Dependency Injection**: Full DI container with interface-based services
- **Background Services**: Hosted service architecture for continuous monitoring
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Repository pattern, service layer, proper separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management with graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-frequency file changes with batching
- **Scalability**: Configurable concurrency and resource management
